This is another reimplementation of TextCNN proposed by Yoon Kim in paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882).

In this implementation, I try to structure the model by class and some interfaces such as inference, training, loss and so on.

The model is implemented with Tensorflow. There is an excellent tutorial [here](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/). This blog and the implementation introduced in it give a great help to me.
